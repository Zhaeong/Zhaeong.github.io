          <h1>Dune <i>(3hr Fan Cut)</i></h1>
          <p><i>August 10, 2015</i></p>

The effects are really dated now. Lynch is more suited to more personal, dramatic movies about nightmares. When he tacked the sf epic, it was a bit of a miscast. The movie is still enjoyable, but you really need to understand dune’s story beforehand. This 3hr cut has a few janky moments, which really takes you out of the film, but you gotta appreciate what this dude’s trying to do.

Concerning dune the the sf series though, it’s got such a deep, and richly imagined world. One of those grand serieses that takes you out of yourself and into that world. The oil-spice subtext is there, but almost completely in the background of all the different politics and technologies of this world. Truly a classic.
