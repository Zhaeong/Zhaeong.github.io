Talked to the producer briefly after the screening. Asked him about the dream sequence. Said it was the only left in the film after several others were cut. Should have mentioned how it was almost Lychian.

The film seemed masturbatory though. That’s often the case with lead actor, writer, and director types. They are all egotistical control freaks, they’d probably agree. Especially if - like Van Warmerdam - they come from a family of enablers. His last film was nominated for a Palme d’Or though, so I should check that out if I’m want to substantiate this claim.
Why masturbatory? Well it seems like the thought process of the film was to create a modern day fairytale, with two anti-heroes. He’s obviously playing the reluctant, weathered one. The stoic, cool one. The drug-abusing, lady-killer type. It’s a fine film, but it seems like escapism for the author.

Maybe the reason for my hate is because I so want to be like him, but probably never will. It’s a fantasy I’ll never appreciate.
