            George Clooney helmed neo-noir bad-ass stoic main character driven killer flick. Oh, he’s really cold, and uncaring because the job made him that way grr. Immediately shown in the first scene, when he kills an innocent lady, his lover, in cold-blood, and from behind. I guess this is one of those films that gets the label “slow-burning”. It was well made, and acting was ok, not that any of  the scenes stretched anyone’s acting muscles. Save for the ending, it was pretty bland, boring, and derivative. It felt like Le Samourai meets….well it just feels like Le Samourai with a hamfisted love as salvation trope mixed in. But the ending saved the movie, any ending where the protagonist dies elegantly is alright with me. Him clasping the windshield with his blood soaked hands, his own blood. The windshield separating him, from his “salvation”, he can see it, it’s there, so close yet so far, and ultimately futile, because he never belonged in that world. So in summation, a movie that didn’t need to be made, but it still had its moments.
