Midlife crisis, falling in love, fallout out of love, and adult sameness. Need to watch more Charlie Kaufman films. Need to not take young 11 year old brother to such an explicit and confounding film. Thought how explicit could claymation get...It gets really fucking explicit in this film.
<br>
The overall themes of the film weren’t obscured at all, it was such a clear, succinct, and direct screenplay. Completely different from Synecdoche, New York. Did the tedium of claymation force them to do that? It’s gotta be one of the reasons.
<br>
It had one the most beautiful, and realistic -I assume lol-  sex scenes I’ve ever seen. It didn’t use claymation to escalate reality, rather it used it to show its fakeness? Plasticity? A metaphor how one can see nothing as real? Not sure, could be a good thesis.
