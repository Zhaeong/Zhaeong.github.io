Japanese anti abortion melodrama about a benevolent kidnapping of a 4 month baby until she’s 4 years. The kidnapper is the mistress of the father, who’s unable to have a baby of her own due to an abortion. The story deals themes of childhood scarring, motherhood, and cultish bonds. The delivery is via segmented vignettes intercrossed between the abductor/abductee, mother/reclaimed abductee, and a confused grown up abductee spiraling into actions mirroring the abductor. 
<br>
The abductor/abductee storyline is the focal story here, the other ones acting as background. Overall well made, touching, well-acted (except for the grown up abductee), and well paced. But I didn’t feel anything in the end, even though the story desperately tried to make its audience emotional, just not my type of movie I guess.
