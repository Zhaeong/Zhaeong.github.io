So not what I usually see. I think my grandparents would have enjoyed it, not my real grandparents, the cultural gap would be way too big. But my fictional grandparents, the strong alert grandparents, that donates to the opera, is involved in various community outreach programs, and has a cottage in PEI. They’ve lived a fairly normal life, and views movies as a healthy distraction. They don’t like the action, violence and sex most modern movies have nowadays. They like the feel-good movies, with a clearly discernable antagonist (who better than the nazis), a resolution that ties everything together in a bow, no interpretation needed. They go away from the film saying “well gosh, I thought that was a very interesting event that happened, I didn’t know about that”, “I’d always thought that those Nazi fellers were bad people” and perhaps “What a lot of fuss for something trivial, but I think it was the right thing”.
<br>
What I’m saying is that it’s a very oscar-baity movie, a romcom for grandparents. It even had the girl showing up spontaneously at the end supporting the lawyer dude. Also some very Oscar bait acting near the ending “I left them there!”, I expect no less from Helen Mirren.

<i>Reinterpreted Ending Dialog Suggestion</i>
<br>
Father in Sickbed (F.I.S): “And now before you go I ask of only one thing - have a long drawn out case against a government that is portrayed as borderline nazi-sympathizers, dismiss all suggestion that the reason for the case is greed, reinforce that point doubly. Even to the point of having the Ryan Gosling Lawyer character break down in a bathroom after reaching a crisis of conscious at a holocaust memorial. This also gives Ryan Gosling a chance for some Oscar-Bait performance of his own. Two birds one Stone. Also show a heavy-handed message at the end stating that the nazies are still bad people, and some art still has not been returned, thereby giving the movie a pseudo-moral higher message. There my lovely Maria, do this for me.

Camera cuts to Maria crying tears of joy and sadness.

Camera cuts to father crying tears of joy and sadness.
<br>
Camera cuts to Helen Mirren smiling, but in a proud sad way.

Fade to Black. Message Displays. Credits Roll.
