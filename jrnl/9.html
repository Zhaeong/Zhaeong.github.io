            Honestly unsure as to why I went and saw this movie...Maybe it was cuz I was bored. Pure commercialism, at least I didnâ€™t have to pay the full ticket price. It is a bit overly cynical of me, because I went in with the assumption of mediocrity and an attempt to cash in on cuteness and child-like wonder i.e. commercialization of innocence.
            <br>
The assumption of mediocrity is due to the fact that whenever a film is created based on a likeable side-character of the original film, it ends up being long-winded and tiring. The original side-character works best out of focus, and in small doses. In a feature film that dose is lethal, and it becomes tiring in the end. This is all true in the film, but I went in with these presumptions that I think detracted from my experience, I must be getting old.
