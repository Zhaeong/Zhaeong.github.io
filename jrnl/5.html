            A fixed-camera, voyeuristic, experimental, and absurdist film by Swedish director Roy Andersson. Need to eventually watch the first two films of this trilogy, because at times was lost during what I assume were callbacks. Said to be inspired by Bicycle Thieves, but perhaps needs a reviewing in order to discern that comparison. Something about really sad, loser type male figures that makes them so appealing from an artistic perspective. Maybe itâ€™s their nobility in poverty.
