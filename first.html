          <h1>Nov 12, 2013</h1>
          <p>
          Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br>
          The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br>
          Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>
          Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>
          The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br>
          The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br>
          The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>
          Are full of passionate intensity.<br>
<br>
          Surely some revelation is at hand;<br>
          Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br>
          The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br>
          When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br>
          Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;<br>
          A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br>
          A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br>
          Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br>
          Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br>
<br>
          The darkness drops again but now I know<br>
          That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br>
          Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br>
          And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>
          Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br>
          -Yeats, 1919
