          <h1>Art School Confidential</h1>

Terry Zwigoff, the same guy that did Crumb. Damn fine film I thought. It seems like it was mostly panned by critics though. The main argument being that it started off as an art school satire, and then veered off course into black comedy. That’s complete bullshit though. It’s still satire, but perhaps not as mild as you once thought. It has a powerful ending, the protagonist gets everything he ever wanted, but in a cynical way that demonizes the art world. That’s satire at its cold hearted best.

Sure, none of the characters other than the protagonist seems like real people in anyway. All of them caricatures of art school types, the film’s introduction is pretty much this. But it’s not that type of movie, it isn’t about characters, it’s an examination on the value of Art, and the way we treasure certain art due to its creator more than its own merit.
