            As depressing, yet somehow life-affirming as I remembered it. However it’s impact dulled during this second viewing, probably due to my getting distracted during the viewing. The best documentaries seem to somehow have better narratives than non-documentary films of the same caliber. It must be that immediate knowledge that even though documentaries dissects the real into a narrative, it is still somewhat true, thusly the characters feel more “alive”. Alive in the sense that it’s a truly 3D character (because it’s a real person, duh), and not just the product of someone’s imagination.
