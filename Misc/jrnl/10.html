            I think I can speak for society on this matter. We look down on drug addicts and aimlessness. In media however, it’s heartbreakingly beautiful. As any intro media student can say, “I want to create beauty”, so some of these films becomes almost depravedly voyeuristic. This one is different, the drug addict is the creator of the film, which gives it a mark of genuineness. It’s a slice of life of a life rife with strife (Exercise: try saying that a few times). I enjoyed it, I do wish it was a bit longer with more dialog, but that is the depraved voyeuristic part of myself talking.
