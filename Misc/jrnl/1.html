            Kristen Wiig helmed comedy-drama (hate that phrase, such genre bullshit). Mentally unwell lady wins lottery, decides to use money to produce a lifestyle show about own life. It’s a commentary on celebrity culture, trashy daytime shows, and its audience. Just not sure what that commentary is exactly. A quirky (such bullshit adjective) film for sure, but would probably not want to see again. Theory A, her need to broadcast her life is an extension of Andy Warhol's 15 min of fame schpiel, when inherent narcissism meets fortune, all that’s missing is fame. Theory B, daytime trashy aspirational TV shows prey on the weak and vulnerable, a positive feed back loop of loneliness. Unsure, maybe it’s not my fault, and the movie’s message wasn’t clear, but feel dumb from that assertion.
